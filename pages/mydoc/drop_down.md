2. **Label:** This property allows you to provide a descriptive label or caption for the Drop-Down field, indicating the purpose or context of the available options.
3. **Help Text:** You can add additional explanatory text in the Help Text property, providing guidance or instructions to users regarding the available options or any specific information they need to consider while making their selection.
4. **Placeholder:** The Placeholder property allows you to set temporary example or prompt text within the Drop-Down field, giving users a hint or suggestion about the expected selection.
5. **Tag Line:** The Tag Line property enables you to add a small line of text below the Drop-Down field, which can be used to provide further instructions or additional context related to the available options.
6. **Select Size (Small, Medium, Large):** This property allows you to choose the size or width of the Drop-Down field, offering flexibility in the visual presentation based on your design preferences or requirements.
7. **Add Options:** By clicking the "+" logo, you can dynamically add more options to the Drop-Down field. Additionally, the error logo allows you to add sub-options under specific options, and the "-" logo allows you to remove options as needed.
8. **Use in Workflow Checkbox:** Enabling this checkbox indicates that the selected option from the Drop-Down field should be utilized within the form's workflow or further processes.
9. **Multi-Select Checkbox:** Enabling this checkbox allows users to select multiple options from the Drop-Down field instead of just one, transforming it into a multi-select field.

1. **Field Can Be Hidden from the Responder:** Enabling this checkbox allows you to hide the Drop-Down field from the form responder or user. This can be useful when you want to collect certain data without displaying the field visibly. It allows you to gather information in the background or based on specific conditions.
2. **Filtrate Checkbox:** By selecting this checkbox, you enable the "filtrate" feature for the Drop-Down field. Filtrate refers to the capability of the input field to act as a filter or search parameter for data. This allows users to input values that can be used to filter or narrow down results in a connected system or database.
3. **Visible to Dropdown:** The Visible to dropdown allows you to specify which individuals or groups the Drop-Down field should be visible to. By selecting specific persons or groups from the dropdown, you can restrict the visibility of the field to only those selected individuals.
