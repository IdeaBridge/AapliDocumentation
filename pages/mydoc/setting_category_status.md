In the Application Category Panel, users can set the status of a category to "Active" or "Inactive" depending on their needs. The current status of each category is displayed in the "Status" column of the panel.

{% include image.html file="setting_the_status_application_category.jpg" class="docimage" url="https://admin.aapli.co/admin/operations/application-categories" alt="Setting Status, Active/Inactive" caption="Setting Status, Active/Inactive" %}

To change the status of a category, click on the "Eye" icon located in the "Status" column. If the category is currently active, clicking on the "Eye" icon will deactivate it, causing the icon to appear blurred. Similarly, if the category is inactive, clicking on the "Eye" icon will activate it, causing the icon to become clear.

When a category is activated or deactivated, a pop-up message will appear confirming the change. This feature allows users to easily manage and control the visibility and availability of application categories.
