In the Basic tab, you will find the following options:
1. **Required Checkbox:** By enabling this checkbox, you make the Multi Line Input field mandatory, ensuring that users must provide a value before submitting the form.
2. **Disable HTML Editor Checkbox:** Enabling this checkbox disables the HTML editor for the Multi Line Input field. It prevents users from using HTML formatting or embedding code within the input area.
3. **Label:** This property allows you to provide a descriptive label or caption for the Multi Line Input field. It helps users understand the purpose or expected input for the field.
4. **Help Text:** You can add additional explanatory text in the Help Text property. It serves as guidance or instructions for users regarding the input requirements or any specific information they need to provide.
5. **Placeholder:** The Placeholder property lets you set temporary example or prompt text inside the Multi Line Input field. It assists users by suggesting the type of input expected in the field.
6. **Tag Line:** The Tag Line property enables you to add a small line of text below the Multi Line Input field. It can be used to provide further instructions or additional context related to the input.
7. **Regex:** The Regex property allows you to define a regular expression pattern that the input value must match. This provides advanced validation capabilities, such as checking for specific formats or patterns in the input.
8. **Character Limit:** Here, you can specify the maximum number of characters allowed in the Multi Line Input field. It restricts the length of the input and can be useful in situations where you have a specific character limit.

1. **Field Can Be Hidden from the Responder:** Enabling this checkbox allows you to hide the Multi Line Input field from the form responder or user. This can be useful when you want to collect certain data without displaying the field visibly. It allows you to gather information in the background or based on specific conditions.
2. **Filtrate Checkbox:** By selecting this checkbox, you enable the "filtrate" feature for the Multi Line Input field. Filtrate refers to the capability of the input field to act as a filter or search parameter for data. This allows users to input values that can be used to filter or narrow down results in a connected system or database.
3. **Visible to Dropdown:** The Visible to dropdown allows you to specify which individuals or groups the Multi Line Input field should be visible to. By selecting specific persons or groups from the dropdown, you can restrict the visibility of the field to only those selected individuals.
